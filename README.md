# Tic-Tac-Toe

An interactive two player tic-tac-toe game. This project was made following Arash Ahadzadeh's "The Complete React Bootcamp 2020 (w/ React Hooks, Firebase)" class.

In this project I've learned the basics of React, specifically how to conditional render elements, manage simple statement hooks and apply style to a react application.
